# Data workflow

data.js array holds all event objects, both past and future. 
Each object is structured according to the interface

eventUtils.js takes the raw data array and translates into numbers

    - getPastEvents filters all events and returns only events that already happened
        - getTotalConcerts 
        - getTotalAwards 
        - getCountriesToured 

Statistics.tsx uses these functions to display the numbers
// import { getTotalConcerts, getTotalAwards, getCountriesToured } from '../utils/eventUtils';
